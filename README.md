# Tic Tac Toe

A simple **Tic Tac Toe** game built as a practice project.  
It features a **retro-themed UI** and allows two players to take turns playing on the same device.

## About the Project
This front-end project was created to practice **JavaScript factory functions** and the **module pattern**.  
The focus was on organizing code cleanly, managing game state, and updating the UI dynamically based on user actions.
